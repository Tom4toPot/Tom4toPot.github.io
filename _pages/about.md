I am currently a PhD student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I am advised by [Prof. William A. Sethares](https://sethares.engr.wisc.edu/), with
whom I pursue my studies on the application of machine learning. With a strong interest in both image processing and natural language processing, I am committed to finding innovative solutions to real-life problems through my research.

Before started my PhD, I received my master's degree from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at UW-Madison. I worked with [Prof. Po-Ling Loh](https://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/~pll28/), studying anomalies detection and robost statistics, with several projects in nuclear field.
Before that, I studied Communication Engineering at [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/) in Shanghai, China.
